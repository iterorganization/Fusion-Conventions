# Fusion Conventions

The Fusion Conventions are a set of rules and guidelines for storing
Fusion-related data (both modeling and experimental data) as labeled
N-dimensional arrays. These conventions are inspired by the Climate and Forecast
Metadata Conventions ([CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/)).
